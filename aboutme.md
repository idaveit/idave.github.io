Hi, I am Davide.

I am Head of Technology at Duet Group, based in the UK.

During my career I often found myself trying to solve all sorts of IT issues, from Windows problems to firewall issues. And more than once, at the end, I thought to myself: I wish someone had written about this before!

In this blog I write about how I found solutions to some of these problems I encountered, for the benefit of the wider IT community. Hopefully, someone will read something here and benefit from it.

If you want to know more about me and my professional career, here is a link to my LinkedIn Profile:
